abstract = {Simulated annealing is a popular local search meta-heuristic used to address discrete and, to a lesser extent, continuous optimization problems. The key feature of simulated annealing is that it provides a means to escape local optima by allowing hill-climbing moves (i.e., moves which worsen the objective function value) in hopes of finding a global optimum. A brief history of simulated annealing is presented, including a review of its application to discrete and continuous optimization problems. Convergence theory for simulated annealing is reviewed, as well as recent advances in the analysis of finite time performance. Other local search algorithms are discussed in terms of their relationship to simulated annealing. The chapter also presents practical guidelines for the implementation of simulated annealing in terms of cooling schedules, neighborhood functions, and appropriate applications.},

abstract = {In recent years, silica films have emerged as a novel class of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Several groups succeeded in epitaxial growth of ultrathin SiO2layers using different growth methods and various substrates. The structures consist of tetrahedral [SiO4] building blocks in two mirror symmetrical planes, connected via oxygen bridges. This arrangement is called a silica bilayer as it is the thinnest 2D arrangement with the stoichiometry SiO2known today. With all bonds saturated within the nano-sheet, the interaction with the substrate is based on van der Waals forces. Complex ring networks are observed, including hexagonal honeycomb lattices, point defects and domain boundaries, as well as amorphous domains. The network structures are highly tuneable through variation of the substrate, deposition parameters, cooling procedure, introducing dopants or intercalating small species. The amorphous networks and structural defects were resolved with atomic resolution microscopy and modeled with density functional theory and molecular dynamics. Such data contribute to our understanding of the formation and characteristic motifs of glassy systems. Growth studies and doping with other chemical elements reveal ways to tune ring sizes and defects as well as chemical reactivities. The pristine films have been utilized as molecular sieves and for confining molecules in nanocatalysis. Post growth hydroxylation can be used to tweak the reactivity as well. The electronic properties of silica bilayers are favourable for using silica as insulators in 2D material stacks. Due to the fully saturated atomic structure, the bilayer interacts weakly with the substrate and can be described as quasi-freestanding. Recently, a mm-scale film transfer under structure retention has been demonstrated. The chemical and mechanical stability of silica bilayers is very promising for technological applications in 2D heterostacks. Due to the impact of this bilayer system for glass science, catalysis and the field of 2D materials, a large number of theoretical and experimental studies on silica bilayers have been reported in the last years. This review aims to provide an overview on the insights gained on this material and to point out opportunities for further discovery in various fields.},

abstract = {D'Arcy Thompson emphasised the importance of surface tension as a potential driving force in establishing cell shape and topology within tissues. Leaf epidermal pavement cells grow into jigsaw-piece shapes, highly deviating from such classical forms. We investigate the topology of developingArabidopsisleaves composed solely of pavement cells. Image analysis of around 50,000 cells reveals a clear and unique topological signature, deviating from previously studied epidermal tissues. This topological distribution is established early during leaf development, already before the typical pavement cell shapes emerge, with topological homeostasis maintained throughout growth and unaltered between division and maturation zones. Simulating graph models, we identify a heuristic cellular division rule that reproduces the observed topology. Our parsimonious model predicts how and when cells effectively place their division plane with respect to their neighbours. We verify the predicted dynamics throughin vivotracking of 800 mitotic events, and conclude that the distinct topology is not a direct consequence of the jigsaw piece-like shape of the cells, but rather owes itself to a strongly life history-driven process, with limited impact from cell-surface mechanics.},

abstract = {Phenobarbital (PB) is a non-genotoxic liver tumor promoter used extensively in initiation-promotion protocols. To determine the mode of PB action, double transgenic mice overexpressing both the c-myc and transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha genes were treated with PB in the food for 10 weeks, from 3 weeks of age. After 3-4 weeks on PB a peak in liver mass was noted, which subsequently leveled off at a value approximately 30{\%} above untreated animals. The mitotic index in mice given PB peaked at 1 week of treatment and was significantly elevated compared with untreated animals. No significant difference between treated and untreated animals was seen thereafter, although a trend of PB-associated mitotic suppression was noticeable. The apoptotic index also showed a trend of suppression compared with untreated animals, significant after prolonged PB administration. Dysplastic hepatocytes were more prominent in PB-treated mice than untreated animals, particularly pericentrally. Removal of PB from the diet at 4 weeks of treatment led to a dramatic increase in apoptosis. This accompanied a drop in the liver mass to the level of untreated controls by 10 days. Throughout the study, PB-treated animals showed markedly lower levels of TGF-beta1 ligand, coincident with an elevated level of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. On withdrawal of PB, the levels of all these proteins rapidly changed to mirror those seen in untreated mice. In all treatment groups, no change in the levels of epidermal growth factor receptor, TGF-beta receptors I and II or Bcl-xS/L were seen. We conclude from our data that PB stimulates liver growth in double transgenic c-myc/TGF-alpha mice by induction of liver hypertrophy and inhibition of apoptosis, brought about by both a decrease in signaling through the TGF-beta pathway and an increase in Bcl-2. The data support the hypothesis that PB promotes neoplastic development through a reduction in the incidence of cell death.},

abstract = {One of the most interesting questions in solid state theory is the structure of glass, which has eluded researchers since the early 1900's. Since then, two competing models, the random network theory and the crystallite theory, have both gathered experimental support. Here, we present a direct, atomic-level structural analysis during a crystal-to-glass transformation, including all intermediate stages. We introduce disorder on a 2D crystal, graphene, gradually, utilizing the electron beam of a transmission electron microscope, which allows us to capture the atomic structure at each step. The change from a crystal to a glass happens suddenly, and at a surprisingly early stage. Right after the transition, the disorder manifests as a vitreous network separating individual crystallites, similar to the modern version of the crystallite theory. However, upon increasing disorder, the vitreous areas grow on the expense of the crystallites and the structure turns into a random network. Thereby, our results show that, at least in the case of a 2D structure, both of the models can be correct, and can even describe the same material at different degrees of disorder.},

abstract = {The predominantly hexagonal cell pattern of simple epithelia was noted in the earliest microscopic analyses of animal tissues, a topology commonly thought to reflect cell sorting into optimally packed honeycomb arrays. Here we use a discrete Markov model validated by time-lapse microscopy and clonal analysis to demonstrate that the distribution of polygonal cell types in epithelia is not a result of cell packing, but rather a direct mathematical consequence of cell proliferation. On the basis of in vivo analysis of mitotic cell junction dynamics in Drosophila imaginal discs, we mathematically predict the convergence of epithelial topology to a fixed equilibrium distribution of cellular polygons. This distribution is empirically confirmed in tissue samples from vertebrate, arthropod and cnidarian organisms, suggesting that a similar proliferation-dependent cell pattern underlies pattern formation and morphogenesis throughout the metazoa.},

abstract = {Defects in graphene alter its electrical, chemical, magnetic and mechanical properties. The intentional creation of defects in graphene offers a means for engineering its properties. Techniques such as ion irradiation intentionally induce atomic defects in graphene, for example, divacancies, but these defects are randomly scattered over large distances. Control of defect formation with nanoscale precision remains a significant challenge. Here we show control over both the location and average complexity of defect formation in graphene by tailoring its exposure to a focussed electron beam. Divacancies and larger disordered structures are produced within a 10 × 10 nm(2) region of graphene and imaged after creation using an aberration-corrected transmission electron microscope. Some of the created defects were stable, whereas others relaxed to simpler structures through bond rotations and surface adatom incorporation. These results are important for the utilization of atomic defects in graphene-based research.},

We show that the motifs of isolated point defects in these 2D structures with otherwise very different properties are similar, and include Stone-Wales-type defects formed by structural unit rotations, flower defects and reconstructed double vacancies. The morphology and energetics of extended defects, such as grain boundaries have much in common as well. As both sp(2)-hybridised carbon and bilayer silica can also form amorphous structures, our results indicate that the morphology of imperfect 2D honeycomb lattices is largely governed by the underlying symmetry of the lattice.},

abstract = {We computer model a free-standing vitreous silica bilayer which has recently been synthesized and characterized experimentally in landmark work. Here we model the bilayer using a computer assembly procedure that starts from a single layer of amorphous graphene, generated using a bond switching algorithm from an initially crystalline graphene structure. Next each bond is decorated with an oxygen atom and the carbon atoms are relabeled as silicon. This monolayer can be now thought of as a two dimensional network of corner sharing triangles. Next each triangle is made into a tetrahedron, by raising the silicon atom above each triangle and adding an additional singly coordinated oxygen atom at the apex. The final step is to mirror reflect this layer to form a second layer and then attach the two layers together to form the bilayer. We show that this vitreous silica bilayer has the additional macroscopic degrees of freedom to easily form a network of identical corner sharing tetrahedra if there is a symmetry plane through the center of the bilayer going through the layer of oxygen ions that join the upper and lower layers. This has the consequence that the upper rings lie exactly above the lower rings, which are tilted in general. The assumption of a network of perfect corner sharing tetrahedra leads to a range of possible densities that we have previously characterized in three dimensional zeolites as a flexibility window. Finally, using a realistic potential, we have relaxed the bilayer to determine the density, and other structural characteristics such as the Si-Si pair distribution functions and the Si-O-Si bond angle distribution, which are compared to the experimental results obtained by direct imaging.},

To study the structure formation of silica in two dimensions, we introduce a two-body force field, based on a soft core Yukawa potential. The different configurations, sampled via Molecular dynamics simulations, can be directly compared with the experimental structures, which have been provided in the literature. The parameters of the force field are obtained from comparison of the nearest-neighbor distances between experiment and simulation. Further key properties such as angle distributions, distribution of ring sizes and triplets of rings are analyzed and compared with the experiment. Of particular interest is the spatial correlation of ring sizes. In general, we observe a very good agreement between experiment and simulation. Additional insight from the simulations is provided about the temporal and spatial stability of the rings in dependence of their size.},

abstract = {The growth and microscopic characterization of two-dimensional germania films is presented. Germanium oxide monolayer films were grownon Ru(0001) by physical vapor deposition and subsequent annealing in oxygen. We obtain a comprehensive image of the germania film structure by combining intensity-voltage low-energy electron diffraction (I/V-LEED) and ab initio density functional theory (DFT) analysis with atomic-resolution scanning tunnelingmicroscopy (STM) imaging. For benchmarking purposes, the bare Ru(0001) substrate and the (2×2)3O covered Ru(0001) were analyzed with I/V-LEED with respect to previous reports. STM topographic images of the germania film reveal a hexagonal network where the oxygen and germanium atom positions appear in different imaging contrasts. For quantitative LEED, the best agreement has been achieved with DFT structures where the germanium atoms are located preferentially on the top and fcc hollow sites of the Ru(0001) substrate. Moreover, in these atomically flat germania films, local site geometries, i.e., tetrahedral building blocks, ring structures, and domain boundaries, have been identified, indicating possible pathways towards two-dimensional amorphous networks.},

abstract = {For nearly 150 years, it has been recognized that cell shape strongly influences the orientation of the mitotic cleavage plane (e.g.; Hofmeister, 1863). However, we still understand little about the complex interplay between cell shape and cleavage-plane orientation in epithelia, where polygonal cell geometries emerge from multiple factors, including cell packing, cell growth, and cell division itself. Here, using mechanical simulations, we show that the polygonal shapes of individual cells can systematically bias the long-axis orientations of their adjacent mitotic neighbors. Strikingly, analyses of both animal epithelia and plant epidermis confirm a robust and nearly identical correlation between local cell topology and cleavage-plane orientation in vivo. Using simple mathematics, we show that this effect derives from fundamental packing constraints. Our results suggest that local epithelial topology is a key determinant of cleavage-plane orientation, and that cleavage-plane bias may be a widespread property of polygonal cell sheets in plants and animals. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Here, using electron irradiation we create an sp2-hybridized one-atom-thick flat carbon membrane with a random arrangement of polygons, including four-membered carbon rings. We show how the transformation occurs step-by-step by nucleation and growth of low-energy multi-vacancy structures constructed of rotated hexagons and other polygons. Our observations, along with first-principles calculations, provide new insights to the bonding behavior of carbon and dynamics of defects in graphene. The created domains possess a band gap, which may open new possibilities for engineering graphene-based electronic devices.},

It predicts without any adjustable parameters the correlations between the number of sides n of the bubbles (topology) and their areas A (geometry) observed in experiments and numerical simulations of shuffled foams. Detailed statistics show that in shuffled cellular patterns n correlates better with √A (as claimed by Desch and Feltham) than with A (as claimed by Lewis and widely assumed in the literature). At the level of the whole foam, standard deviations $\Delta$n and $\Delta$A are in proportion. Possible applications include correlations of the detailed distributions of n and A, three-dimensional foams, and biological tissues.},

abstract = {A tessellation of Dirichlet polygons is generated from a pattern of points distributed at random over a rectangular grid, and a simple method is devised to disturb the clumps that are a characteristic feature of such a pattern, by subjecting the pattern to a clustering process. The process consists in applying a regular, periodic variation to the line-spacing of the grid. If the period of the variation is sufficiently small, or sufficiently large, the clumping is found to be scarcely affected by the clustering; but there is a narrow range of scale within which the two aggregative processes appear to interfere with each other. This interference is accompanied by a sudden and marked change in the topological properties of neighboring polygons of the tessellation, and an attempt is made to describe this change quantitatively in terms of previously established parameters. The importance of finding a physical counterpart of this geometrical effect is stressed. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

@article{Malashevich2016,
abstract = {Density functional theory was used to assess the viability of approaches to controlling the structure of a recently discovered two-dimensional form of SiO2. In accord with prior work, a hexagonal bilayer of mirror image planes of corner-sharing SiO4 tetrahedra in six-membered rings yielded only a slightly higher energy than $\alpha$-quartz. Structures including four- through eight-membered rings were evaluated and in certain cases found to be as little as 17 meV/Si higher in energy than the hexagonal bilayer. When either biaxial or uniaxial tensile strain was applied, combinations of eight-, six-, and four-membered rings became favored due to the lower density of structures with larger rings. These findings, together with experiments that reveal expansion of silica bilayers to match the lattice of metal substrates, suggest that epitaxial strain may be used to control the bilayer structure. Replacement of Si with Ge and Al as prototypical tetravalent and trivalent dopants was also investigated. Substituting Ge for Si was energetically unfavorable and offered no obvious advantage for structural control over pure SiO2 bilayers. In contrast, Al substitution was energetically favorable and only minimally distorted the bilayer. It was found that while the hexagonal bilayer remained favored, the extra-framework electron donors K and H that accompany each Al preferred to occupy larger rings when possible, thus forcing Al to reside in large rings as well. This suggests that the bilayer structure may be controlled through substitution of Si for trivalent dopants and selection of extra-framework electron donors that favor larger rings.},
