@article{Roy2018,
abstract = {The recent experimental discovery of a semi two-dimensional silica glass has offered a realistic description of the random network theory of a silica glass structure, initially discussed by Zachariasen. To study the structure formation of silica in two dimensions, we introduce a two-body force field, based on a soft core Yukawa potential. The different configurations, sampled via Molecular dynamics simulations, can be directly compared with the experimental structures, which have been provided in the literature. The parameters of the force field are obtained from comparison of the nearest-neighbor distances between experiment and simulation. Further key properties such as angle distributions, distribution of ring sizes and triplets of rings are analyzed and compared with the experiment. Of particular interest is the spatial correlation of ring sizes. In general, we observe a very good agreement between experiment and simulation. Additional insight from the simulations is provided about the temporal and spatial stability of the rings in dependence of their size.},

abstract = {Diverse cellular systems evolve to remarkably similar stationary states. We therefore have studied and simulated a purely topological model. We use a maximum-entropy argument to predict that the average number of l-sided cells adjacent to an n-sided cell, Ml(n), will be linear in n. One consequence is the empirically observed linearity of the total number of edges of cells adjacent to an n-sided cell, known as the Aboav-Weaire law. The prevailing justification of that law is shown to be incorrect, and thus the apparently universal experimental slope of âˆ¼5 remains unexplained.},

abstract = {Amorphous graphene is a realization of a two-dimensional Zachariasen glass as first proposed 80 years ago. Planar continuous random networks of this archetypal two-dimensional network are generated by two complementary simulation methods. In the first, a Monte Carlo bond switching algorithm is employed to systematically amorphize a crystalline graphene sheet. In the second, molecular dynamics simulations are utilized to quench from the high temperature liquid state. The two approaches lead to similar results as detailed here, through the pair distribution function and the associated diffraction pattern. Details of the structure, including ring statistics and angular distortions, are shown to be sensitive to preparation conditions, and await experimental confirmation.},

abstract = {The growth and microscopic characterization of two-dimensional germania films is presented. Germanium oxide monolayer films were grownon Ru(0001) by physical vapor deposition and subsequent annealing in oxygen. We obtain a comprehensive image of the germania film structure by combining intensity-voltage low-energy electron diffraction (I/V-LEED) and ab initio density functional theory (DFT) analysis with atomic-resolution scanning tunnelingmicroscopy (STM) imaging. For benchmarking purposes, the bare Ru(0001) substrate and the (2Ã—2)3O covered Ru(0001) were analyzed with I/V-LEED with respect to previous reports. STM topographic images of the germania film reveal a hexagonal network where the oxygen and germanium atom positions appear in different imaging contrasts. For quantitative LEED, the best agreement has been achieved with DFT structures where the germanium atoms are located preferentially on the top and fcc hollow sites of the Ru(0001) substrate. Moreover, in these atomically flat germania films, local site geometries, i.e., tetrahedral building blocks, ring structures, and domain boundaries, have been identified, indicating possible pathways towards two-dimensional amorphous networks.},

abstract = {In this paper we present an alternative derivation of the Aboav-Weaire law. By first making the assumption that the mean of the number of sides surrounding a cell is a function of the time, leads to Mn, the mean number of sides surrounding a cell of sides n, as a linear function of the second moment $\mu$, and is independent of n. This indicates that the local mean increases with time. When written in the form of the general Aboav-Weaire relation we find in their notation that a = 1 and b = 6 7. The analysis also leads to the relation that the deviation from the ensemble average, 6, is proportional to $\mu$, and b is the coefficient of proportionality. The initial assumption is removed and the assumption that Mn is now a function of time and the number of sides is made. This assumption leads to Mn as a linear function of the ratio $\mu$/(n+1). This applies in the limit of small $\mu$ and the assumption that Mn can be expanded as a Maclaurin series. When written in the form of the general Aboav-Weaire law a = 1 and b = 0. This implies that the deviation from the mean 6 is then proportional to $\mu$/(n+1). A similar analysis is applied to three dimensions and when the faces of the cells are considered we find that the average number of faces of the cells surrounding a cell of face {\{}cauchy integral{\}} is a linear function of $\mu$/({\{}cauchy integral{\}}+;1), where $\mu$ is the second moment of the faces with mean 14. This analysis of the mean number of sides surrounding a cell is extended to finding the mean area surrounding a cell of sides n and area A, MAn. It is found that the mean area of the cells MAn is given by MAn = Aa + (Aa - A)/n, where Aa is the local cell area average which in the first approximation can be treated as the ensemble average area. Similarly the mean volume of cells surrounding a cell of faces {\{}cauchy integral{\}} and volume v is given by Mv{\{}cauchy integral{\}} = va + (va - v)/{\{}cauchy integral{\}}, where va is the average local volume. In this case cells of small areas (volumes) are surrounded by cells of areas (volumes) greater than the average area (volume). We can reverse the argument to show that the large area (volume) cells are surrounded by small area (volume) cells. The results of this analysis indicates that the cells are not randomly distributed. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

@article{Gibson2011,
abstract = {For nearly 150 years, it has been recognized that cell shape strongly influences the orientation of the mitotic cleavage plane (e.g.; Hofmeister, 1863). However, we still understand little about the complex interplay between cell shape and cleavage-plane orientation in epithelia, where polygonal cell geometries emerge from multiple factors, including cell packing, cell growth, and cell division itself. Here, using mechanical simulations, we show that the polygonal shapes of individual cells can systematically bias the long-axis orientations of their adjacent mitotic neighbors. Strikingly, analyses of both animal epithelia and plant epidermis confirm a robust and nearly identical correlation between local cell topology and cleavage-plane orientation in vivo. Using simple mathematics, we show that this effect derives from fundamental packing constraints. Our results suggest that local epithelial topology is a key determinant of cleavage-plane orientation, and that cleavage-plane bias may be a widespread property of polygonal cell sheets in plants and animals. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {One of the most interesting questions in solid state theory is the structure of glass, which has eluded researchers since the early 1900's. Since then, two competing models, the random network theory and the crystallite theory, have both gathered experimental support. Here, we present a direct, atomic-level structural analysis during a crystal-to-glass transformation, including all intermediate stages. We introduce disorder on a 2D crystal, graphene, gradually, utilizing the electron beam of a transmission electron microscope, which allows us to capture the atomic structure at each step. The change from a crystal to a glass happens suddenly, and at a surprisingly early stage. Right after the transition, the disorder manifests as a vitreous network separating individual crystallites, similar to the modern version of the crystallite theory. However, upon increasing disorder, the vitreous areas grow on the expense of the crystallites and the structure turns into a random network. Thereby, our results show that, at least in the case of a 2D structure, both of the models can be correct, and can even describe the same material at different degrees of disorder.},

Techniques such as ion irradiation intentionally induce atomic defects in graphene, for example, divacancies, but these defects are randomly scattered over large distances. Control of defect formation with nanoscale precision remains a significant challenge. Here we show control over both the location and average complexity of defect formation in graphene by tailoring its exposure to a focussed electron beam. Divacancies and larger disordered structures are produced within a 10 Ã— 10 nm(2) region of graphene and imaged after creation using an aberration-corrected transmission electron microscope. Some of the created defects were stable, whereas others relaxed to simpler structures through bond rotations and surface adatom incorporation. These results are important for the utilization of atomic defects in graphene-based research.},

abstract = {Phenobarbital (PB) is a non-genotoxic liver tumor promoter used extensively in initiation-promotion protocols. To determine the mode of PB action, double transgenic mice overexpressing both the c-myc and transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha genes were treated with PB in the food for 10 weeks, from 3 weeks of age. After 3-4 weeks on PB a peak in liver mass was noted, which subsequently leveled off at a value approximately 30{\%} above untreated animals. The mitotic index in mice given PB peaked at 1 week of treatment and was significantly elevated compared with untreated animals. No significant difference between treated and untreated animals was seen thereafter, although a trend of PB-associated mitotic suppression was noticeable. The apoptotic index also showed a trend of suppression compared with untreated animals, significant after prolonged PB administration. Dysplastic hepatocytes were more prominent in PB-treated mice than untreated animals, particularly pericentrally. Removal of PB from the diet at 4 weeks of treatment led to a dramatic increase in apoptosis. This accompanied a drop in the liver mass to the level of untreated controls by 10 days. Throughout the study, PB-treated animals showed markedly lower levels of TGF-beta1 ligand, coincident with an elevated level of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. On withdrawal of PB, the levels of all these proteins rapidly changed to mirror those seen in untreated mice. In all treatment groups, no change in the levels of epidermal growth factor receptor, TGF-beta receptors I and II or Bcl-xS/L were seen. We conclude from our data that PB stimulates liver growth in double transgenic c-myc/TGF-alpha mice by induction of liver hypertrophy and inhibition of apoptosis, brought about by both a decrease in signaling through the TGF-beta pathway and an increase in Bcl-2. The data support the hypothesis that PB promotes neoplastic development through a reduction in the incidence of cell death.},

The key feature of simulated annealing is that it provides a means to escape local optima by allowing hill-climbing moves (i.e., moves which worsen the objective function value) in hopes of finding a global optimum. A brief history of simulated annealing is presented, including a review of its application to discrete and continuous optimization problems. Convergence theory for simulated annealing is reviewed, as well as recent advances in the analysis of finite time performance. Other local search algorithms are discussed in terms of their relationship to simulated annealing. The chapter also presents practical guidelines for the implementation of simulated annealing in terms of cooling schedules, neighborhood functions, and appropriate applications.},

Assessments of ring arrangements around each Si atom and ring neighborhoods are compared against uncorrelated structure predictions.

Significant deviations of the observed structures from the uncorrelated prediction correspond qualitatively with a simple geometric approximation for bond angle frustration.},

abstract = {While crystalline two-dimensional materials have become an experimental reality during the past few years, an amorphous 2-D material has not been reported before. Here, using electron irradiation we create an sp2-hybridized one-atom-thick flat carbon membrane with a random arrangement of polygons, including four-membered carbon rings. We show how the transformation occurs step-by-step by nucleation and growth of low-energy multi-vacancy structures constructed of rotated hexagons and other polygons. Our observations, along with first-principles calculations, provide new insights to the bonding behavior of carbon and dynamics of defects in graphene. The created domains possess a band gap, which may open new possibilities for engineering graphene-based electronic devices.},

We propose a model of an assortative network, which we study both analytically and numerically. Within the framework of this model we find that assortative networks tend to percolate more easily than their disassortative counterparts and that they are also more robust to vertex removal.},

abstract = {Many properties of disordered materials can be understood by looking at idealized structural models, in which the strain is as small as is possible in the absence of long-range order. For covalent amorphous semiconductors and glasses, such an idealized structural model, the continuous random network, was introduced 70 years ago by Zachariasen. In this model, each atom is placed in a crystal-like local environment, with perfect coordination and chemical ordering, yet longer-range order is nonexistent. Defects, such as missing or added bonds, or chemical mismatches, however, are not accounted for. In this paper we explore under what conditions the idealized CRN model without defects captures the properties of the material, and under what conditions defects are an inherent part of the idealized model. We find that the density of defects in tetrahedral networks does not vary smoothly with variations in the interaction strengths, but jumps from close to zero to a finite density. Consequently, in certain materials, defects do not play a role except for being thermodynamical excitations, whereas in others they are a fundamental ingredient of the ideal structure},

abstract = {In planar cellular systems mn denotes the average sidedness of a cell neighbouring an n-sided cell. Aboav's empirical law states that nm(n) is linear in n. A downward curvature is nevertheless observed in the numerical nmn data of the random Voronoi froth. The exact large-n expansion of mn obtained in the present work, namely, m(n) = 4 + 3(pi/n)1/2 + (.) (.) (.) , explains this curvature. Its inverse square root dependence on n sets a new theoretical paradigm. Similar curved behaviour may be expected, and must indeed be looked for, in experimental data of sufficiently high resolution. We argue that it occurs, in particular, in diffusion-limited colloidal aggregation on the basis of recent simulation data due to Fernandez-Toledano et al (2005 Phys. Rev.

@article{Buchner2017,
abstract = {In recent years, silica films have emerged as a novel class of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Several groups succeeded in epitaxial growth of ultrathin SiO2layers using different growth methods and various substrates. The structures consist of tetrahedral [SiO4] building blocks in two mirror symmetrical planes, connected via oxygen bridges. This arrangement is called a silica bilayer as it is the thinnest 2D arrangement with the stoichiometry SiO2known today. With all bonds saturated within the nano-sheet, the interaction with the substrate is based on van der Waals forces. Complex ring networks are observed, including hexagonal honeycomb lattices, point defects and domain boundaries, as well as amorphous domains. The network structures are highly tuneable through variation of the substrate, deposition parameters, cooling procedure, introducing dopants or intercalating small species. The amorphous networks and structural defects were resolved with atomic resolution microscopy and modeled with density functional theory and molecular dynamics. Such data contribute to our understanding of the formation and characteristic motifs of glassy systems. Growth studies and doping with other chemical elements reveal ways to tune ring sizes and defects as well as chemical reactivities. The pristine films have been utilized as molecular sieves and for confining molecules in nanocatalysis. Post growth hydroxylation can be used to tweak the reactivity as well. The electronic properties of silica bilayers are favourable for using silica as insulators in 2D material stacks. Due to the fully saturated atomic structure, the bilayer interacts weakly with the substrate and can be described as quasi-freestanding. Recently, a mm-scale film transfer under structure retention has been demonstrated. The chemical and mechanical stability of silica bilayers is very promising for technological applications in 2D heterostacks. Due to the impact of this bilayer system for glass science, catalysis and the field of 2D materials, a large number of theoretical and experimental studies on silica bilayers have been reported in the last years. This review aims to provide an overview on the insights gained on this material and to point out opportunities for further discovery in various fields.},

@article{Keating1966,
abstract = {After demonstrating inconsistencies in some of the better known elasticity calculations, an alternative method of imposing the necessary invariance conditions on the strain energy of a crystal is presented. The new method is equivalent to the Born-Huang procedure but, in addition to providing further insight, also offers one or two operational advantages. For example, it demonstrates that all purely first-neighbor interactions are central only. The method is applied to the calculation of the elasticity of a two-constant model of the diamond type of crystal, and this predicts the relation 2c44(c11+c12)=(c11-c12)(c11+3c12), which is very well satisfied by the experimental data for diamond, silicon, and germanium.},

Initially, we use the topological separation (measured by the number of intervening rings), but this lead to pseudo-long-range correlations due to a lack of topological charge neutrality in the shells surrounding a central ring. This effect is associated with the non-circular nature of the shells. It is ,therefore, necessary to use the geometrical distance between ring centers. Hence we find a generalization of the Aboav-Weaire law out to larger distances, with the correlations between rings decaying away when two rings are more than about 3 rings apart.},

abstract = {The predominantly hexagonal cell pattern of simple epithelia was noted in the earliest microscopic analyses of animal tissues, a topology commonly thought to reflect cell sorting into optimally packed honeycomb arrays. Here we use a discrete Markov model validated by time-lapse microscopy and clonal analysis to demonstrate that the distribution of polygonal cell types in epithelia is not a result of cell packing, but rather a direct mathematical consequence of cell proliferation. On the basis of in vivo analysis of mitotic cell junction dynamics in Drosophila imaginal discs, we mathematically predict the convergence of epithelial topology to a fixed equilibrium distribution of cellular polygons. This distribution is empirically confirmed in tissue samples from vertebrate, arthropod and cnidarian organisms, suggesting that a similar proliferation-dependent cell pattern underlies pattern formation and morphogenesis throughout the metazoa.},

abstract = {We computer model a free-standing vitreous silica bilayer which has recently been synthesized and characterized experimentally in landmark work. Here we model the bilayer using a computer assembly procedure that starts from a single layer of amorphous graphene, generated using a bond switching algorithm from an initially crystalline graphene structure. Next each bond is decorated with an oxygen atom and the carbon atoms are relabeled as silicon. This monolayer can be now thought of as a two dimensional network of corner sharing triangles. Next each triangle is made into a tetrahedron, by raising the silicon atom above each triangle and adding an additional singly coordinated oxygen atom at the apex. The final step is to mirror reflect this layer to form a second layer and then attach the two layers together to form the bilayer. We show that this vitreous silica bilayer has the additional macroscopic degrees of freedom to easily form a network of identical corner sharing tetrahedra if there is a symmetry plane through the center of the bilayer going through the layer of oxygen ions that join the upper and lower layers. This has the consequence that the upper rings lie exactly above the lower rings, which are tilted in general. The assumption of a network of perfect corner sharing tetrahedra leads to a range of possible densities that we have previously characterized in three dimensional zeolites as a flexibility window. Finally, using a realistic potential, we have relaxed the bilayer to determine the density, and other structural characteristics such as the Si-Si pair distribution functions and the Si-O-Si bond angle distribution, which are compared to the experimental results obtained by direct imaging.},

abstract = {D'Arcy Thompson emphasised the importance of surface tension as a potential driving force in establishing cell shape and topology within tissues. Leaf epidermal pavement cells grow into jigsaw-piece shapes, highly deviating from such classical forms. We investigate the topology of developingArabidopsisleaves composed solely of pavement cells. Image analysis of around 50,000 cells reveals a clear and unique topological signature, deviating from previously studied epidermal tissues. This topological distribution is established early during leaf development, already before the typical pavement cell shapes emerge, with topological homeostasis maintained throughout growth and unaltered between division and maturation zones. Simulating graph models, we identify a heuristic cellular division rule that reproduces the observed topology. Our parsimonious model predicts how and when cells effectively place their division plane with respect to their neighbours. We verify the predicted dynamics throughin vivotracking of 800 mitotic events, and conclude that the distinct topology is not a direct consequence of the jigsaw piece-like shape of the cells, but rather owes itself to a strongly life history-driven process, with limited impact from cell-surface mechanics.},

Using a variation on the sillium approach proposed 14 years ago by Wooten, Winer, and Weaire, we present 1000-atom and 4096-atom configurations with a degree of strain significantly less than the best CRN available at the moment and comparable to experimental results. The low strain is also reflected in the electronic properties.

abstract = {A tessellation of Dirichlet polygons is generated from a pattern of points distributed at random over a rectangular grid, and a simple method is devised to disturb the clumps that are a characteristic feature of such a pattern, by subjecting the pattern to a clustering process. The process consists in applying a regular, periodic variation to the line-spacing of the grid. If the period of the variation is sufficiently small, or sufficiently large, the clumping is found to be scarcely affected by the clustering; but there is a narrow range of scale within which the two aggregative processes appear to interfere with each other. This interference is accompanied by a sudden and marked change in the topological properties of neighboring polygons of the tessellation, and an attempt is made to describe this change quantitatively in terms of previously established parameters. The importance of finding a physical counterpart of this geometrical effect is stressed. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

abstract = {The neighbor network in a two-dimensional polydisperse hard-disk fluid with diameter distribution p(sigma) approximately sigma(-4) is examined using constant-pressure Monte Carlo simulations. Graphs are constructed from vertices (disks) with edges (links) connecting each vertex to k neighboring vertices defined by a radical tessellation. At packing fractions in the range 0.24{\textless} or =eta{\textless} or =0.36, the decay of the network degree distribution is observed to be consistent with the power law k(-gamma) where the exponent lies in the range 5.6{\textless} or =gamma{\textless} or =6.0 . Comparisons with the predictions of a maximum-entropy theory suggest that this apparent power-law behavior is not the asymptotic one and that p(k) approximately k(-4) in the limit k--{\textgreater}infinity. This is consistent with the simple idea that for large disks, the number of neighbors is proportional to the disk diameter. A power-law decay of the network degree distribution is one of the characteristics of a scale-free network. The assortativity of the network is measured and is found to be positive, meaning that vertices of equal degree are connected more often than in a random network. Finally, the equation of state is determined and compared with the prediction from a scaled-particle theory. Very good agreement between simulation and theory is demonstrated.},

The average ring size is fixed at six by topology, but the width, skewness and other moments of the distribution of ring edges are characteristics of particular samples. We examine the Aboav-Weaire law that quantifies the propensity of smaller rings to be adjacent to larger rings, and find similar results for available experimental samples which however differ somewhat from computer-generated bilayers. We introduce a new law for the areas of rings of various sizes.},

@article{Malashevich2016,
abstract = {Density functional theory was used to assess the viability of approaches to controlling the structure of a recently discovered two-dimensional form of SiO2. In accord with prior work, a hexagonal bilayer of mirror image planes of corner-sharing SiO4 tetrahedra in six-membered rings yielded only a slightly higher energy than $\alpha$-quartz. Structures including four- through eight-membered rings were evaluated and in certain cases found to be as little as 17 meV/Si higher in energy than the hexagonal bilayer. When either biaxial or uniaxial tensile strain was applied, combinations of eight-, six-, and four-membered rings became favored due to the lower density of structures with larger rings. These findings, together with experiments that reveal expansion of silica bilayers to match the lattice of metal substrates, suggest that epitaxial strain may be used to control the bilayer structure. Replacement of Si with Ge and Al as prototypical tetravalent and trivalent dopants was also investigated. Substituting Ge for Si was energetically unfavorable and offered no obvious advantage for structural control over pure SiO2 bilayers. In contrast, Al substitution was energetically favorable and only minimally distorted the bilayer. It was found that while the hexagonal bilayer remained favored, the extra-framework electron donors K and H that accompany each Al preferred to occupy larger rings when possible, thus forcing Al to reside in large rings as well. This suggests that the bilayer structure may be controlled through substitution of Si for trivalent dopants and selection of extra-framework electron donors that favor larger rings.},

The discussion is restricted to the distribution of grain shapes in two dimensional sections, as characterized by the topological parameter n, i.e. the number of sides or nearest neighbours, which is also known to be somehow related to grain dimensions. Assuming that only two elementary transformations (interchange of grain neighbours and creation or annihilation of 3-sided grains) can take place in the array, it is predicted that the mean coordination number mn of the nearest neighbours of all n-sided grains is related to n through Weaire's relation: mn = 5 + (6 + $\mu$2)/n in which $\mu$2 is the second central moment of the overall distribution of grain coordination numbers. The latter is generated by Monte-Carlo simulation and it is suggested that a 'normal polycrystalline structure' may be viewed as that grain array most likely to develop when both elementary transformations repeatedly occur at random. Since their relative proportions remain a priori unknown, at least one degree of freedom is available in the model and evolutionary processes, e.g. grain growth can be accounted for within its framework. It is shown with a particular example, that actual microstructures may be found, which can be adequately described by the present model. {\textcopyright} 1979.},

We show that the motifs of isolated point defects in these 2D structures with otherwise very different properties are similar, and include Stone-Wales-type defects formed by structural unit rotations, flower defects and reconstructed double vacancies. The morphology and energetics of extended defects, such as grain boundaries have much in common as well. As both sp(2)-hybridised carbon and bilayer silica can also form amorphous structures, our results indicate that the morphology of imperfect 2D honeycomb lattices is largely governed by the underlying symmetry of the lattice.},

abstract = {Finite pieces of locally isostatic networks have a large number of floppy modes because of missing constraints at the surface. Here we show that by imposing suitable boundary conditions at the surface, the network can be rendered effectively isostatic. We refer to these as anchored boundary conditions. An important example is formed by a two-dimensional network of corner sharing trian-gles, which is the focus of this paper. Another way of rendering such networks isostatic, is by adding an external wire along which all unpinned vertices can slide (sliding boundary conditions). This ap-proach also allows for the incorporation of boundaries associated with internal holes and complex sample geometries, which are illustrated with examples. The recent synthesis of bilayers of vitreous silica has provided impetus for this work. Experimental results from the imaging of finite pieces at the atomic level needs such boundary conditions, if the observed structure is to be computer-refined so that the interior atoms have the perception of being in an infinite isostatic environment. FIG. 1. Showing a piece of bilayer of vitreous silica imaged in SPM (Scanning Probe Microscope) 5 to show the Si atoms as red discs and the O atoms as black discs. The local covalent bonding leads to the yellow almost-equilateral triangles that are freely jointed, which we will refer to as pinned. The triangles at the surface have either one or two vertices unpinned.},
